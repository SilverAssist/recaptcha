# Create Implementation Plan

Create a detailed implementation plan for: **{feature-description}**

## Prerequisites
- Reference: `.github/prompts/_partials/documentation.md` for plan template
- Reference: `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for project conventions

## Steps

### 1. Analyze Request
- Break down the feature into components
- Identify affected areas of the codebase
- Search for related implementations

### 2. Research Current State
- Read relevant source files
- Understand current architecture
- Document existing patterns

### 3. Create Planning Document

Save to: `docs/{feature-name}-plan.md`

Include these sections:

---

# {Feature Name} Implementation Plan
